The dataset that we scrap includes all the txt files.
We mainly use the TagetTable.txt and QueryTable.txt for doing experiment with synonyms.txt as our rule set. 

This python code can be run in any environment with python 3 installed since we do not use special library.

To see each of the small test for each function we wrote: run "test.py"

For the evaluation of similarity measures: run "Evaluate_sim_measure.py"

For the evaluation of join: run "Evaluate_Join.py"

The 2 evaluations will take a couple minutes to run but should not be exceeding 30 minutes.
